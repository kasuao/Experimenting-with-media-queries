		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<hr>
		<img id="profile" src="assets/images/profile.jpg">
		<p>My name is Kelcey Asuao. I have been developing websites since 2004 mostly as a freelancer. I had a stint developing for a
		company called Heritage Web Solutions in 2008 but that was short lived as that company, like many others, went bankrupt during the recession. I continued 
		to develop for clients as a freelancer, and worked as a web consultant for a web hosting company called Bluehost in 2009. After working 
		there for a year I landed my current job as a student mentor at Western Governors University where I mentor students in the Software Development program.
		I have been here for over 7 years now and will make my 8th year in January 2018.</p>
		<p>I enjoy my current job but I have longed to return to a full-time job in development, and that is why I am doing this bootcamp through the U of U. It
		will help me shake off some rust I have collected over the years (while I have continued to code, I haven't kept up with the advancements in the technologies) as well as learn more of the backend technologies of today. These skills will help me find opportuniies for advancement in my current company or find a job elsewhere that will pay similarly with the potential
		for more.</p>
